“Developer Build Example” Instructions:


As you work through this example, keep notes on areas you are not familar with or that are not your strong suit.  For example, if you are not as comfortable with Photoshop, note that and include placeholder divs for any art you were not able to bring over.  If there is something in the code you are not familiar with, take it as far as you can and if applicable, outline the additional steps you expect to be needed.  

Similarly, if you find something you'd ask another developer about or a project manager include those questions in your notes.

Include the notes in the files you submit.


Attached is a Photoshop file, and a source code folder of the html and supporting files, and an PDF document which outlines what work needs to be done on the app.


The app shown here has been created specifically to help demonstrate to potential freelancers what kind of work is done here at this shop in a general way, and for freelancers to demonstrate the extent of their knowledge of Phototshop, HTML, CSS & Javascript/jQuery.  Most of our projects use the kind of interactivity demonstrated here, ie. navigation, popup windows, animated charts & iScrolls, using JavaScript & jQuery. All the required js files have been included.

In addition to coding, freelancers need to be familiar enough with Photoshop to be able to extract images from the .psd file and place them into the appropriate places within the html.

The kind of project that this is an example of runs only on the iPad, and only using local storage. That is, the app is not hosted on a server, a zip is downloaded to the iPad directly and lanunched from within a host iOS app, and you do not need to worry about any other browsers beside Mobile Safari.


If you do not have an iPad to test your work, and you are working on a Mac, please test in desktop Safari. If you are working on a PC, please test using a webkit browser, preferably Chrome.

There is a fair amount of work that needs to be done to complete all the work called for on this project. You don't have to do all work, but please do as much as you have the ability to complete & which will help demonstrate your skill set.
